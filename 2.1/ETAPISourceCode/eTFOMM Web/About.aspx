    </h2>
    <p>
        enhanced Transportation Flow Open Microscopic Model (eTFOMM) stands on top of the 40 year FHWA traffic simulation algorithms and flow theories with advanced computing updates. ETFOMM is a microscopic traffic simulator, which  means that each vehicle is modeled as it moves through a traffic system. It also facilitates both path based simulation and traditional turning percentage based simulation, and provides cross platform (e.g., smartphone and iPad) and state-of-the-art application program interfaces (API) to potentially facilitate US DOT’s connected vehicle research.
